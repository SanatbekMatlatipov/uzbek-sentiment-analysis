Simple and fast, what else?

Fully working Google Translate API for python 2.7 and 3.x

As simple as that:
`translate("Bonjour","en","auto")` will return "Hello"

The mtranslate project has been slightly modified to be used for specific purposes.
The original mtranslate can be found from: https://github.com/mouuff/mtranslate

Also on PyPi:
