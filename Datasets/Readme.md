For creating Uzbek language reviews Datasets, Google Play Store Applications have been chosen as the data source for our research.
Because, Android retains a share of more than 85% of the mobile Operating Systems market (as of February 2019) in Uzbekistan.

 It was manually annotated by two annotators,also considering the star rating provided by the reviewers.We also presented another new and relatively larger (20K)dataset of the same type, but this time it was automaticallytranslated to Uzbek using Google Translate from an exist-ing app review dataset in English language

While the translated dataset is quite balanced, the manually annotated dataset has about 3:4 ratio of negative to positive reviews.
